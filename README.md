This utility was designed for use with devices compatible with the MagicHome Wifi app. 

It currently supports:
   Bulbs (Firmware v.4 and greater)
   Legacy Bulbs (Firmware v.3 and lower)
   RGB Controllers
   RGB+WW Controllers
   RGB+WW+CW Controllers

##### Commands:
   Turning devices on and off
   Getting current device states
   Setting either colors, or whites (in bulbs)
   Setting colors (+ WW + CW) in compatible devices
   Sending preset functions

	
##### Tasks:
   Initial device setup via UDP.
   Custom commands (I know how it works ... just not a priority to implement currently.)
   Setting the device's internal clock.

##### Notes:
   Device types are:
      0: RGB
      1: RGB+WW
      2: RGB+WW+CW
      3: Bulb (v.4+)
      4: Bulb (v.3-)
      (Higher numbers reserved for future use)

   Functions accept integers 0-255 as parameters, or their equivalent byte format.
